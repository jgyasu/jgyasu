I am an engineering undergraduate at the National Institute of Technology Agartala, India. I have been programming computers since middle school when I coded graphics in LOGO. Over the years, my passion for technology made me work with various languages and frameworks. For the last 1.5 years, I have been actively studying and working in the field of Machine Learning and lately Large Language Models.

I have worked with a team at [AIISC](https://aiisc.ai/), University of South Carolina, researching watermarking methods for LLM-generated content where I extensively used Python and tools like Hugging Face, OpenAI API, Pytest, and Langchain among others. Back in high school, I wrote a Python library called [Fileaway](https://pypi.org/project/fileaway/), packaged it, and published it on PyPi. I have also contributed to projects in the PyData ecosystem like sktime, SciPy, and scikit-image, which made me realize that contributing to open-source software is the epitome of human collaboration :)
